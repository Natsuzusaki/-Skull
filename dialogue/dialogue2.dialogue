Yuna: What is this? It looks like one of those glasses you use when handling chemicals in a laboratory

Yuna: Yeah that, but it could be a visor or something
Yuna: It's very thin, not good for protecting
Yuna: Im gonna wear it anyways
Yuna: I love glasses

Yuna: Integer? Throw? Where do we even throw the integer?
- In that question mark?
do camera.focus_on_point(code_block)
Yuna: Sure Einstein, we'll try that later
do camera.focus_on_player(true, true)
Yuna: The big question is where are we suppose to see a grid?
- Glasses
Yuna: These thing? really?
Yuna: I have to double check
Yuna: Yeah theres a note inside, don't tell me how i didn't notice it at first
Yuna: the note says "Press G to see grid"
Yuna: ðŸ˜¤
Yuna: Wow how blatant, i think someone is running out of ideas
Yuna: What else are we missing?
Yuna: Oh yeah what are we moving anyway?
- Integer
	do camera.focus_on_point(int_obj)
	Yuna: Not sure, we can already move them ourself
	Yuna: I don't think thats it
	Yuna: How about that wall
- Yuna
	Yuna: Do I look like I'm disabled?
	Yuna: Try finding an object we can't move, like that wall blocking our way
- Wall
do camera.focus_on_point(wall)
Yuna: That wall does look suspicious
Yuna: And it has a dot in the middle
